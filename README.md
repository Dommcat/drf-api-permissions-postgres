# 401 Advanced Python LAB - Class 32

## Author: Dominck Martin

## Project: drf-api-permissions-postgres

## Feature Tasks and Requirements


- You have been supplied with two demos, each presenting a key new feature.
- One demonstrates how to restrict access to portions of your APIs data.
- The other demonstrates switching over to using postgres vs sqlite
- Your job is to merge the functionality of both demos.
- Customize your project to use different application features/models than what was used in demos.
- Features - Django REST Framework
- Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
- Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
- Add a custom permission so that only appropriate users can update or delete it.
- Exactly what this means will depend on your application, so if you have any questions about “appropriate users” means reach out to TA/Instructor.
- Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.
- Features - Docker

- NOTE Refer to demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.
- create Dockerfile based off python:3.10-slim
- create docker-compose.yml to run Django app as a web service.
- enter docker compose up --build to start your site.
- add postgres as a service
